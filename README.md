# Connected Crossroad

*Connected Crossroad* is an android application that utilizes Google's nearby connections API to create a mobile ad-hoc network between android devices in an effort to help create a connected transportation system. Specifically, it allows pedestrians to easily notify drivers with their intentions to cross roads.

This application is in active development at the University of Virginia as part of the "Exploring Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) to Enable Connected
Transportation Services" research being conducted in [Dr. Haiying Shen's Pervasive Communications Laboratory](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hs6ms/research.htm).

More details to come soon.
